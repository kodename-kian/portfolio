# My Personal Portfolio!
A good exercise in front-end work and a long-term storage for all my projects, achievements, and more, launching my portfolio website 
coincides well with the start of my second year @ UBC. These next few months are going to be chaotic, but at the end of it all,
I'm hoping it's going to be worth it ;)

## Always a work in progress!
I've got a lot planned still for this website, including but not up to getting my own domain ðŸ‘€ So make sure to check back in regularly 
for updates on everything that I've been up to!
